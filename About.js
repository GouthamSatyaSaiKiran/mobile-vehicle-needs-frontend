        When vehicle users experience fuel shortages or vehicle breakdowns,
        they often encounter slow and inconvenient traditional services,
        forcing them to wait for assistance or travel to refueling stations.
        However, this application aims to offer a satisfactory conclusion by
        providing on-demand fuel delivery and roadside assistance directly to
        the driver's location, ensuring quick, convenient, and reliable
        solutions that get them back on the road with minimal disruption.
